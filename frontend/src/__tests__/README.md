# About frontend testing

## Goals

- Write an automated unit test for every major feature

## Limitations - because of time constraints

- UI/UX is in this case simple -> no need to make automated unit tests for how the elements look
- Only autotesting dynamic parts

## Manual testing

- E2E testing, because of simplicity and time
